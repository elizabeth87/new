       Story goes that after a few months of coding and a few full stack crash courses you become a skilled programmer. Well at 
       least that's what I read in someones overly optimistic blog. In my experience I have been learning to code for about 10 months now and 
       unlike the blogs promise, I feel far from a programmer. I didn't start my coding journey believing that any length of time would make me a skilled programmer or 
       any type of whiz for that matter. Instead I started my coding journey knowing it would be a tough incline but also knew or had hope 
       it would be one filled with life lessons along the way. So far the ladder one is the winner. Having to find solutions for complex
       problems is what drives my interest in my learning every day. I find that it has made me a more vocal learner since collaboration
       seems key as you work in teams to create projects. My favorite part has been learning to approach problems in a more logical
       way. It has pushed me to become much more patient with myself when encountering tough challenges. The logic kicks in and my brain
       starts looking and breaking up problems in a different way now. So I may not be at the top of the programming mountain to call 
       myself a self taugh programmer but I'am climbing every day. So stick around if you want updates about my journey in the world of tech.
